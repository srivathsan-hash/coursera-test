Serving as the eponymous protagonist of the series, he is a young ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village).

Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations (OVA), as well as the sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations by Ukyo Kodachi, where he is the Hokage and his son, Boruto, is the protagonist.</div id="ig">

However, in the anime, his pants were denim, and his shoes were bright red. When Yuji enrolled into the Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, he began wearing his version of the uniform; a black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a red hoodie, black pants, and red shoes.Yuji is famous for his superhuman physical abilities, earning him the nickname "The Tiger of West Junior High" before becoming a sorcerer.

<article>Light Yagamiüòà</article>
<p>Light Yagami (Â§úÁ•ûÊúà, Yagami Raito) is the main protagonist of the Death Note series. After discovering the Death Note, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals. His killings are eventually labelled by people of Japan as the work of "Kira".Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good with problem solving, Light was a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios. Furthermore, Light was very popular among peers and adored by his family members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.Similar to his father, Light has a strong sense of justice but this quickly becomes warped after he becomes tainted by the notebook‚Äôs power. Believing the world to be "rotten," he uses his Death Note as a means by which he can enact his will to rid the world of evil people. Light's main goal is to create a new world that is free of injustice and populated only with people whom he deems honest and kind, thus becoming the "God of the new world".</p>
